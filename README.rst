Extended Autocomplete provides a few features that are not available
in the default autocomplete widget shipped with `Deform
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/deform/en/latest/>`_. Essentially,
Extended Autocomplete allows the developer to show a value to the user
that is different from the one that is returned by the widget (and
eventually stored).

For further details, see the documentation at
`<https://deform-ext-autocomplete.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
